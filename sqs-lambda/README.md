# Amazon SQS to AWS Lambda

The SAM template deploys a Lambda function, an SQS queue and the IAM permissions required to run the application. SQS invokes the Lambda function when new messages are available.

Learn more about this pattern at Serverless Land Patterns: [serverlessland.com/patterns/sql-lambda](https://serverlessland.com/patterns/sqs-lambda)

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [NodeJS 12.x installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Deployment Instructions

1. [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and login.

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [install the AWS Serverless Application Model CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) on your local machine.

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and enter ```git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns/tree/main/lambda-eventbridge```.

1. Change directory to this pattern.

1. From the command line, run:
```
sam deploy --guided
```
Choose a stack name, select the desired AWS Region, and allow SAM to create roles with the required permissions. Once you have run guided mode once, you can use `sam deploy` in future to use these defaugitlts.

1. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and ARNs.

                "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
                "SentTimestamp": "1612966720445",

            "awsRegion": "us-east-1"
        }
    ]
}

```
### Testing

Use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to send a message to the SQS queue and observe the event delivered to the Lambda function:

1. Send the SQS message:
```bash
aws sqs send-message --queue-url ENTER_YOUR_SQS_QUEUE_URL --message-body "Test message"
```
2. Retrieve the logs from the Lambda function:
```bash
sam logs -n ENTER_YOUR_CONSUMER_FUNCTION_NAME
```
